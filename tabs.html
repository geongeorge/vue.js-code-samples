          I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor.
          I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too.
           I still don't know why. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
           It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor.
            Well, they call me the Doctor.

          God created pudding, and then he rested.
          Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is
           computerized. I've lived in darkness a long time.
            Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark
            became my world and I could see.

            There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
            intelligent. Dissect its brain! It's just like the story of the
            grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept
            burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his
            girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came,
            and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.
             Also he got a race car.
             Is any of this getting through to you?
